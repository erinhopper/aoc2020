***Day 1: Report Repair***
expensereport.py
Finding two/three numbers in a list that sum to 2020
Before you leave, you have to fix the elves' accounting report.

***Day 2: Password Philosophy***
passwordcorruption.py
Using string indexing to determine validity of passwords
To rent a toboggan to get to the airport, you have to help the rental company fix their password system.

***Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory***
toboggan.py
Traversing a repeating 2D array in certain patterns.
You have to figure out which angle of tobogganing down a slope will hit the least trees. 

***Day 4: Passport Processing***
passports.py
Using string manipulation to determine validity of passports
The airport's passport scanning system is slow. You should make it faster and also make sure it will accept your North Pole  Credentials.

***Day 5: Binary Boarding***
planeseats.py
Interpreting strings as binary numbers
You lost your plane ticket, but your plane numbers numbers seats as binary strings, and you have to analyze all of the other ticket numbers to figure out your own.

***Day 6: Custom Customs***
customsforms.py
Using set operations ‘&’ and ‘|’ to fill out customs forms
You are helping families around you fill out customs forms.

***Day 7: Handy Haversacks***
bags.py
Using trees and dynamic programming to recursively count the parents/children of a specific node
Rules for luggage processing specify which bags are contained in other colors of bags, which can go very deep. You have to figure out how this relates to your shiny gold bag.

***Day 8: Handheld Halting***
console.py
Interpreting simple, code-like instructions to identify and fix an infinite loop
On a new connecting flight, the kid sitting next to you asks you to fix their handheld game console, which is not running due to an infinite loop.

***Day 9: Encoding Error***
encoding.py
Manipulating a list of numbers to exploit a weakness in an encryption system
You are trying to decode information from a port on the screen on the seat in front of you.

***Day 10: Adapter Array***
adapters.py
Sorting a list and counting combinations with partitioning
You need to charge your computer to check how a tropical storm will affect your plans, but it is dead. You need to use a number of adapters to charge it from the plane.

***Day 11: Seating System***
seating.py
Implementing variations of Conway’s Game of Life until an equilibrium is reached
On the next leg of your trip, a ferry ride, passengers sit according to specific rules. 

***Day 12: Rain Risk***
directions.py
Following navigation instructions to determine the location of a ship
The storm interrupts the ferry, but its navigation system is broken. You have to fix it.

***Day 13: Shuttle Search***
buses.py
Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to solve a set of modulo equations
Once the ferry docks, you will have to use a bus to get to the nearest airport, which all come at different intervals starting at time zero. You can also solve a problem to win a star in a contest.

***Day 14: Docking Data***
bitwise.py
Using variations of bitmasks to encode data
You need to emulate a decoder chip so the ferry can communicate with the docking program and dock correctly.

***Day 15: Rambunctious Recitation***
reciting.py
Simulating a memory game with optimized data structures to predict the outcome
On your next flight, the elves call you to explain a memory game they've been playing.

***Day 16: Ticket Translation***
tickets.py
Using rules to determine the validity of strings and solve a logic puzzle with the process of elimination
You can't read the language on the ticket to your next connecting flight, so you decide so use known parameters and the other passenger's tickets to figure out which data field is which.

***Day 17: Conway Cubes***
conway.py
Implementing six cycles of variations of Conway’s Game of Life in three and four dimensions
On the plane, the elves call you to ask for help with an energy source on their imaging satellite, which is a living set of cubes in a pocket dimension.

***Day 18: Operation Order***
operations.py
Evaluating simple mathematical expressions with custom orders of operations
The kid next to you on the plane asks for help with their math homework.

***Day 19: Monster Messages***
messages.py
Using recursively building rules with and without roots to determine the validity of strings
The elves ask you for help uncorrupting messages from their imaging satellite based on a set of rules.

***Day 20: Jurassic Jigsaw***
jigsaw.py
Assembling a puzzle by reorienting 10x10 grid pieces and matching edges and searching for specific patterns in the resulting array
You look at the elves' (now uncorrupted) data to look for a sea monster, but you have to assemble the image first.

***Day 21: Allergen Assessment***
allergens.py
Using logic to determine which ingredients match to allergens
The last leg of your journey is a raft, which you need to pack food for. You can't read the language, so you have to use logic to figure out which ingredient contain allergens.

***Day 22: Crab Combat***
crabcards.py
Simulating a recursive version of the card game War to determine outcome
You decide to play cards with a small crab who is on the raft with you.

***Day 23: Crab Cups***
crabcups.py
Using linked lists to simulate a circular game of moving cups
Now, the crab challenges you to a game; you have to predict where stars will be hidden after the crab shuffles cups around.

***Day 24: Lobby Layout***
tiling.py
Implementing 100 cycles of a variation of Conway’s Game of Life on an infinite hexagonal grid
Finally at your hotel lobby, you have to help builders place hexagonal tiles on the floor.

***Day 25: Combo Breaker***
combo.py
Using brute force and modular arithmetic to break a cryptographic handshake and clicking a button
Your room key doesn't work, but you manage to reverse engineer the cryptographic handshake. Unfortunately, the elves call you back to the north pole to fix the soft serve machine, but the reindeer they sent to pick you up brings you a star.
